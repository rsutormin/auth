OVERVIEW
--------

Java client for the KBase authorization service (and Globus Online directly
where the KBase auth service doesn't yet have the required functionality).
See the versions file for a mapping of git commit -> version.

VERSION 0.4.2 (Released 8/25/16)
--------------------------------

NEW FEATURES:
- AuthConfig.withAllowInsecureURLs allows setting insecure URLs for the 
  purposes of testing.

VERSION 0.4.1 (Released 8/7/16)
--------------------------------

BUG FIXES
- Fixed a bug that allowed configuration of incorrect urls.
- Token cache now stores a SHA-256 digest of the token rather than the token
  itself.

VERSION 0.4.0 (Released 7/31/16)
--------------------------------

BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBILITIES:
- All RefreshingToken methods and classes are deprecated. They will fail once
  the new auth service is released.
- AuthConfig.getToken now returns an AuthToken from the RefreshingToken or
  standard token, depending on which one is set.
- The validateToken methods now only take a string for the token and return an
  AuthToken. Validation errors now throw an exception rather than returning
  false.
- All references to token expiration times have been removed.
- All getters in AuthToken have been removed other than getUserName and
  getToken() (a new method).
- The AuthToken constructor now takes a username and a token string.
- AuthToken.toString() now returns a string representation of the AuthToken
  object. Use getToken() to retrieve the token string.
- Tokens are now cached for at most 5 minutes and getting a token does not
  reset the expiration time.
- Many getters are removed from AuthUser. Only those fields compatible with
  the new auth service remain.
  
NEW FEATURES:
- The AuthConfig object now has a withToken method, which can be used to set
  a standard token instead of a refreshing token for querying users.


VERSION 0.3.2 (Released 6/9/16)
-------------------------------

BUG FIXES
- Globus token lifetime changed back to previous value, so duplicated in
  Authtoken class.
- Made RefreshingToken.getToken() synchronized.

VERSION 0.3.1 (Released 5/15/15)
------------------------------------------

BUG FIXES
- Fix for KBASE-2024 - looking up user info from Globus used a URL based on
  the group path (i.e. /groups/[groupid]/members/[userid]), but not all kbase
  users are in the kbase users group, thus WS sharing breaks for about 1/10th of
  users which need to verify that the user account exists.  The URL was switched
  to /users/[userid], which returns a user record regardless of group affiliation. 


VERSION 0.3.0 (Released 4/8/15)
------------------------------------------

NEW FEATURES
- Added a new class, ConfigurableAuthService, that is instantiable and
  configurable. Restored the prior behavior to the AuthService class.

VERSION 0.2.0 (Released 4/8/15) DEPRECATED - use 0.3.0
------------------------------------------

NEW FEATURES
- The auth client is now instantiable rather than static.
- The auth client may now be configured with endpoint URLs and the Globus group
  to query for users.
- The client can now produce a token that refreshes itself periodically.
- The client can be configured with a token to use for all user queries. In
  most cases this should be an administrator of the kbase group, since if users
  set their profiles to private they are invisible to standard users.

UPDATED FEATURES / BUG FIXES
- Fix tests to deal with kbasetest user status changes.
- Account for change in Globus token lifetime (-1 day).
- Use alternative API to get user details since the current API no longer
  works the way we use it. The new API was recommended by Globus.
- Users outside of the kbase_users group will now no longer show up in user
  validation or details queries.

VERSION 0.1.0 (Released 4/25/2014)
------------------------------------------
This is the most recent version that exists in http://github.com/kbase/jars 
(kbase-auth-1398468950-3552bb2.jar).
No release notes existed at this point, so this version will serve as the 
baseline for future changes.
